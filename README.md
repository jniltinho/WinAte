My goal is to provide an easy way to migrate from Windows 7/8 to GNU/Linux, without having a high end pc. Everything is done using the less resource-intensive software available, always trying to keep as much functionality as possible.
It is meant to be used in LXDE/Openbox, so don't expect to have neither rounded corners nor exactly the same look and feel as in Windows. That's not even a secondary goal.


Requirements:

- LXPanel
- LXSession (>= 0.4.9)(icons, gtk theme and cursor)
- PCManFM (wallpaper)
- Compton
- Openbox
- SLiM (for login screen)

Description:

With this brand-new WinAte - Windows 7/8 Transformation Pack for LXDE - you will be able to get all the icons and overall appearance of Windows to your GNU/Linux box, without spending lots of resources nor having to adapt old Gnome 2 themes. Everything works just by executing the install.sh script. Just do that, logout and login again, and there should be a different feeling in the whole system.

I took some stuff from the old Win2-7 pack, and a bit of inspiration from the Imagine 7 and Imagine 8 themes for Openbox. All the config files, and the modifications to both sources were made entirely by me. Find me in Taringa.net

Required packages: gtk2-engines-murrine; gtk2-engines-pixbuf; compton.

IMPORTANT: THIS PACK HAS BEEN DESIGNED TO WORK WITH DEBIAN 8 (JESSIE), AND PROBABLY WON\'T WORK WITH ANY PREVIOUS VERSION. UBUNTU IS CURRENTLY SUPPORTED (BY INSTALLING LXDE PACKAGE AND COMPTON PPA), BUT LUBUNTU ISN\'T (THERE WILL BE AN UPDATE AVAILABLE SOON TO GET IT WORKING PROPERLY

For updating the pack, please uninstall any previous version first.

Con este completo pack de transformación de Windows 7 para LXDE, podrás modificar la experiencia de usuario y facilitar tu llegada al mundo de GNU/Linux! Sólo ejecuta el script \"install.sh\" en una terminal, cierra sesión y, al volver, todo estará renovado. 100% Libre.

Tomé algunas cosas del antiguo Win2-7 pack, y me inspiré un poco en los temas para Openbox Imagine 7 e Imagine 8 (pero no me gustaron del todo, por eso hice los míos propios). Todos los archivos de configuración y modificaciones a las fuentes las hice enteramente yo. Búscame en Taringa.net :)

IMPORTANTE: ESTE PACK ESTÁ DISEÑADO PARA FUNCIONAR CON DEBIAN 8 (JESSIE), Y PROBABLEMENTE NO FUNCIONE CON NADA ANTERIOR. UBUNTU ACTUALMENTE ESTÁ SOPORTADO (INSTALANDO PREVIAMENTE EL PAQUETE LXDE), PERO LUBUNTU NO (HABRÁ UNA ACTUALIZACIÓN PRONTO QUE LO SOPORTARÁ)
